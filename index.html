                 <ul>
                    <li>I graduated with my Bachelors of Computer Science and a specialty in web development in July 2024.
                         I also graduated magna cum laude, despite working full time, going to school full time, and having a small child!</li>
                    <li>I do daily coding challenges using <a href="https://www.codewars.com">Code Wars.</a>
                         It's free, and I think it is organized the best of everywhere I have tried. My main focus there is JavaScript at this time.
                          You can view my <a href="https://www.codewars.com/users/SpinnerTalltail">portfolio</a> and <a href="https://www.codewars.com/users/SpinnerTalltail/completed_solutions">my kata (code) solutions</a> in these embedded links.

                    <li>I am currently working on making this webpage from scratch. Goals for the site include:
                        <ul>
                            <li>Adding my custom-made art, which I am creating in Aseprite.</li>
                            <li>Create interactive components using JavaScript. This will hopefully include animating my art.</li>
                            <li>Eventually have backend features using PHP and something like MySQL.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <li>
                        Future Planned Projects:
                        <ul>
                            <li>A recipe app. I'm very inspired by <a href="https://recipekeeperonline.com/">Recipe Keeper</a>, 
                             but I also want so many features that don't exist in any apps that I can find. Therefore, 
                            I plan to create a website that is capable of everything I <em>do want</em> in a recipe-keeping 
                            and searcing application.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                I love webpages like <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/">D&D Beyond</a>, but I had created 
                                 my own tools long ago and have preferences that do not exist in websites like these. I want to try 
                                 my hand at creating my own role-playing game tools as a webpage. I love video games and TTRPGs, and 
                                 creating support for those games is one of the ways that I got started really feeling passionately 
                                 about programming, so this is something I will tackle for sure.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                I have also had an interest in creating games either using Java, since I practiced it so much in 
                                college, or perhaps with Python, another language I am a fan of. I haven't decided on concrete ideas 
                                for this yet as you can see I already have a few ambitious projects in the works above!

                    Because this site can be publically searched, I am 
                    cautious about putting too much identifying information here. 
                    Time permitting, I will add a form to safely submit requests to me, but 
                    in the meantime, here are some options for reaching out to me:
