            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I do daily coding challenges using <a href="https://www.codewars.com">Code Wars.</a> It's free, and I love it the most of everywhere I have tried. My main focus there is JavaScript.

                I made this webpage from scratch. Important elements about this page will be added here as I create them.

                which you can view here: <a href="https://www.warriormassage.com">Warrior Massage</a>
